# Neovim Configuration

This configuration is tailored to my workflow and preferences, 
but feel free to use it as a starting point for your own setup.

I structured my plugins folder using the category names from 
the awesome-neovim repository. 
For example, "marks.lua" includes the "harpoon" plugin.

Happy coding!
